1. WAV to MP3 Conversor

As a musician, I'm used to record demos and share them with my friends to get a feedback. We all know that WAV files are a bit difficult to share because of its size.

Although there are several sites to convert WAV to MP3, this short script allows you to do it locally and protects your files from whatever the site does with them.

Please refer to the library repository in case you have any issues with audio codecs needed: https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub.

2. Password Checker

This short script allows you to check in the wide known site https://haveibeenpwned.com/ if your password was leaked or if it is a safe one.

It can take as many arguments as you want when running from terminal.

This is the process it follows:
  a. It'll hash the passwords provided on the arguments and get the first 5 characters from the hash.
  b. It retrieves a list of hashed passwords (which have been exposed as per the site) that start with those 5 characters.
  c. It compares your hashed passwords with the list retrieved and tells you if you are in danger because of password leakage.

As it is compared locally, your passwords are always secure ;)

3. News_Scrapping

Do you want to avoid those colorful photos that mess up with your concentration when reading the news?

This script will allow you to have a feed with all the titles and links of the news of a site. 
In this case, I've worked with √Åmbito, which is an argentinian economics and finance newspaper.
You can either print them into the console when executing or export them to a basic html file.

It also includes a filter to search for a particular word or phrase. It will tell you if the word or phrase don't return any results.
